# Running
* `npm install`
* Create a `.env` file:
 - Go to the Google Cloud Console for Common Prefix.
 - Go to the APIs & Services â†’ Credentials page and click on the "Create credentials" button.
 - Select the "Service account" responsible for the leaderboard
 - Click on "Keys"
 - Download the JSON file
 - Create a `.env` file in the root of this repository
 - The .env file should have a single line stating: GOOGLE_AUTH='...'
 - The '...' should be the whole JSON-encoded file that you downloaded, without new lines, so that it can be decoded using JSON.parse.
 - Be careful when converting: The JSON file you download from Google is not JSON. It is executable JS (it contains string concatenations).
* For dev:
  - `npm run dev`
* For production
  - Build using `npm run build`
  - Run using `npm run start`, or, for persistence, use `pm2 start npm --name 'common-prefix-leaderboard' -- start`
